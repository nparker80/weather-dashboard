<h1>Weather Dashboard</h1>

I created a dashboard so that travelers can easily check the weather for a given city. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. OpenWeather is the third-party app I utilized for the API calls.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
<br>
WHEN I search for a city
<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
<br>
WHEN I view the UV index
<br>
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
<br>
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
<br>
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
